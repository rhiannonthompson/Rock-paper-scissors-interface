# Rock Paper Scissors
You MUST play rock paper scissors or the computer will win! [Live demo](https://rhiannonthompson.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-game/).

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Figma

## Description
Rock Paper Scissors was designed as a fun exercise for learning how to use conditional logic to manipulate the DOM. I built the entire game using vanilla JavaScript and styled it with responsive CSS. Media queries are used to ensure Rock Paper Scissors is playable on most screen sizes. I also used Figma to design all the cards and buttons.
